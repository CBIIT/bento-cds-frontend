  content:
    - paragraph: "Bento is an open source framework developed by the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research to support data sharing. It provides a structure to enable groups to quickly stand up and then configure a data sharing environment for life science data - groups can use Bento to share data amongst themselves or with a larger community. Bento's reference implementation contains a data model that is compatible with the Cancer Research Data Commons' Harmonized model (CRDC-H) such that Bento instances can be connected into and inter-operate with the CRDC. Users can customize the data model for their own needs. Bento also contains a User Interface and an API for programmatic access."

    - paragraph: "The model works with diverse data types, offering robust yet flexible infrastructure while adhering to FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse) data principles. CRDC Data Hub continues to evolve to meet the data needs for various NCI-funded programs."
    - paragraph: "All code necessary to use the $$[Bento platform](https://bento-tools.org/#/)$$ on which the CRDC Data Hub portal is built is provided in the form of Docker containers. However, the Bento code is also available to the public for research and forking and pull requests. There are a number of CRDC Data Model resources to explore on the CDS GitHub page including the CRDC Core Data Model: $$[https://github.com/CBIIT/cds-model](https://github.com/CBIIT/cds-model)$$."

    - paragraph: "The Cancer Data Service provides data sharing capabilities for additional studies that fall under the following categories:"
    - listWithBullets: 
      - "Studies with data that do not match any existing CRDC data commons (Proteomic Data Commons, Genomic Data Commons, Imaging Data Commons, Clinical and Translational Data Commons, and Integrated Canine Data Commons)"
      - "Studies with data that do not fit current data type criteria and/or the minimum metadata standards for any CRDC data commons"
    - paragraph: "CDS is home to a combination of open and controlled access data, however, the CDS portal is accessible for users to search and browse with no required login. This allows users to check if the CDS portal has data of interest before going through the process of requesting access to controlled access data through the NCBI’s $$[dbGaP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/)$$ system"
    - paragraph: "Open access data is publicly accessible; it does not require any approvals. Being a cloud repository, the CDS portal does not facilitate direct downloads of data, owing to high data download charges. However, programs/initiatives can reach out to $$[NCICRDC@mail.nih.gov](NCICRDC@mail.nih.gov)$$ to request downloads if willing to fund the download for users approved to access their data. Please contact the CRDC helpdesk for further information."

    - listWithBullets:
      - "Search by participant IDs by uploading a list of known IDs to have the data associated with those participants returned"

    - paragraph: "Once a researcher has filtered down to a set of files of interest, that set can be saved to the portal \"shopping cart,\" from which an export manifest can be generated.

These cloud resources provide access to on-demand computational capacity to analyze data. They also allow users to run best practice tools and pipelines already implemented or to upload their own data or analysis methods to secure workspaces."
    - paragraph: "All cloud resources provide support for data access through a web-based user interface in addition to programmatic access to analytic tools and workflows, and the capability of sharing results with collaborators. Each cloud resource is continually developing new functionality to improve the user experience and add new tools for researchers."
    - paragraph: "CRDC currently has a collaboration with $$[Velsera Cancer Genomics Cloud](https://www.cancergenomicscloud.org)$$(SBG), which is hosted on Amazon Web Services and has a rich user interface that allows researchers to find data of interest and combine it with their own private data. Data can be analyzed using more than 200 preinstalled, curated bioinformatics tools and workflows. Researchers can also extend the functionality of the platform by adding their own data and tools via an intuitive software development kit."

  content:
    - paragraph: "Bento is an open source framework developed by the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research to support data sharing. It provides a structure to enable groups to quickly stand up and then configure a data sharing environment for life science data - groups can use Bento to share data amongst themselves or with a larger community. Bento's reference implementation contains a data model that is compatible with the Cancer Research Data Commons' Harmonized model (CRDC-H) such that Bento instances can be connected into and inter-operate with the CRDC. Users can customize the data model for their own needs. Bento also contains a User Interface and an API for programmatic access."

      - "Studies with data that do not match any existing CRDC data commons"
      - "Studies with data that do not fit current data type criteria and/or the minimum metadata standards for any CRDC data commons"
    - paragraph: "The CDS is home to a combination of open and controlled access data, however, the CDS Portal is accessible for users to search and browse with no required login. This allows users to check if CDS has data of interest before going through the process of requesting access to controlled access data through the NCBI’s $$[dbGaP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/)$$ system"
    - paragraph: "Open access data is publicly accessible; it does not require any approvals.

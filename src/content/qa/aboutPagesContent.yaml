  content:
    - paragraph: "Bento is an open source framework developed by the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research to support data sharing. It provides a structure to enable groups to quickly stand up and then configure a data sharing environment for life science data - groups can use Bento to share data amongst themselves or with a larger community. Bento's reference implementation contains a data model that is compatible with the Cancer Research Data Commons' Harmonized model (CRDC-H) such that Bento instances can be connected into and inter-operate with the CRDC. Users can customize the data model for their own needs. Bento also contains a User Interface and an API for programmatic access."

    - paragraph: "$$#ABOUT CDS#$$"
    - paragraph: "The Cancer Data Service (CDS) is a data repository under the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) infrastructure for storing cancer research data generated by NCI funded programs. CDS provides secure and authorized storage and data sharing capabilities in the cloud for studies that can fall under either of the categories below:"
    - paragraph: "-   Studies with data which do not fit current data type criteria for submission, and/or do not meet minimum metadata standards for submission to a CRDC Data Commons"
    - paragraph: "-   Studies with data that do not have a Data Commons set up for the data type"
    - paragraph: "-   Studies which are on a waiting list on a specific Data Commons for storage such as the Genomics Data Commons (GDC). "
    - paragraph: "-   Studies which are still evolving and do not have a place to store their data and analyze it during acquisition phase. "
    - paragraph: "CDS hosts both controlled and open access data. Permission to access most controlled data on CDS is obtained through the familiar $$[dbGaP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/)$$ system.   If a controlled access project is not listed in the dbGaP system, contact the $$[CDS Helpdesk](cdshelpdesk@mail.nih.gov)$$ for more information.  Open access datasets do not require authorization and are freely accessible."
    - paragraph: "The CDS Data Portal offers users a variety of ways to search data and download a manifest to export information to one of NCI’s Cloud Resources where users can analyze the data."
    - paragraph: "CDS contains a variety of data from different NCI projects such as HTAN and CCDI as well as data from independent research projects.  While the majority of the data in CDS are genomic, CDS does accept other data types, such as microscopy images, with additional data types planned for the future.  The data in CDS is a combination of open and controlled access, however the CDS Data Portal is free for users to search and browse, no login is required.  This will allow users to understand if CDS has the data that is of their interest before needing to go through the dbGaP access approval process."
    - paragraph: "Users can filter the files available by a variety of methods on the Data page.  If users know the participant IDs from another source, they can upload a list and have the data associated with those participants returned.  If the users wants to do a new search, they can use filters including Study, Experimental Strategy, Gender, Tumor, and FileType.  Users looking for a more programmatic approach can query the entire CDS schema using the GraphQL endpoint.  Once users have filtered down to a set of files that they are interested in, they can save the files to their shopping cart and then export a manifest file containing all the information needed to import their files to the Seven Bridges Genomic GCG and carry out their analysis. More information on importing files from CDS to SBG-CGC can be found $$[here](https://docs.cancergenomicscloud.org/docs/import-cds-data)$$."
    - paragraph: "The CDS Data Portal also hosts descriptions and additional information about the studies and programs that have deposited data in CDS.  These are linked to the search page making it easy to find all the data from a specific study."
    - paragraph: ""
    - paragraph: "$$#DATA ANALYSIS #$$"
    - paragraph: "CDS hosts data and offers analysis capabilities on the NCI Cloud resources. $$[Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud](https://www.cancergenomicscloud.org)$$ (SBG), is one of the NCI’s Cloud Resources that CDS works closely with, and can be used as a primary resource for analyzing data. Data in CDS can also be accessed from the other CRDC Cloud resources, $$[ISB-CGC](https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/)$$, and $$[Broad Firecloud](https://firecloud.terra.bio/)$$. While SB-CGC is established on Amazon Web Services (AWS), ISB-CGC and Broad FireCloud are on Google Cloud, which may impact which Cloud Resource you choose."

  content:
    - paragraph: "The Cancer Research Data Commons is an initiative from NCI’s Center for Biomedical Informatics & Information Technology (CBIIT). CBIIT’s vision for the project consists of a virtual, expandable infrastructure that provides secure access to many different data types across scientific domains, allowing users to analyze, share, and store results, leveraging the storage and elastic compute, or ability to easily scale resources, of the cloud. The ability to combine diverse data types and perform cross-domain analysis of large data sets can lead to new discoveries in cancer prevention, treatment and diagnosis, and supports the goals of precision medicine and the Cancer Moonshot℠."
    - paragraph: ""
    - paragraph: "$$#CLOUD RESOURCES#$$"
    - paragraph: "The CRDC has three Cloud Resources ($$[Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud](https://www.cancergenomicscloud.org)$$  ,$$[ISB Cancer Genomics Cloud](https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/)$$ , $$[Broad Firecloud](https://firecloud.terra.bio/)$$ ), each providing analysis platforms for the community to use when working with Data Commons data."
    - paragraph: "These cloud-based platforms eliminate the need for researchers to download and store extremely large data sets by allowing them to bring analysis tools to the data in the cloud, instead of the traditional process of bringing the data to the tools on local hardware. The Cloud Resources also provide access to on-demand computational capacity to analyze these data. The Cloud Resources allow users to run best practice tools and pipelines already implemented or upload their own data or analysis methods to workspaces."
    - paragraph: "All three Cloud Resources provide support for data access through a web-based user interface in addition to programmatic access to analytic tools and workflows, and the capability of sharing results with collaborators. Each Cloud Resource is continually developing new functionality to improve the user experience and add new tools for researchers."
    - paragraph: "$$[SEVEN BRIDGES CANCER GENOMICS CLOUD](https://www.cancergenomicscloud.org)$$(SBG) is hosted on Amazon Web Services and has a rich user interface that allows researchers to find data of interest and combine it with their own private data. Data can be analyzed using more than 200 preinstalled, curated bioinformatics tools and workflows. Researchers can also extend the functionality of the platform by adding their own data and tools via an intuitive software development kit."
    - paragraph: "$$[INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY CANCER GENOMICS CLOUD](https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/)$$(ISB-CGC)  leveraging many aspects of the Google Cloud Platform, allows scientists to interactively define and compare cohorts, examine underlying molecular data for specific genes and pathways, and share insights with collaborators. For computational users, Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources such as BigQuery and Google Pipeline service, allow complex queries from R or Python scripts, or Dockerized workflows to run on data available in the Google Cloud Storage."
    - paragraph: "$$[BROAD INSTITUTE FIRECLOUD](https://firecloud.terra.bio/)$$ is an open, standards-based platform for performing production-scale data analysis in the cloud. Built on the Google Cloud Platform, Firecloud empowers analysts, tool developers, and production managers to run large-scale analysis and to share results with collaborators. Users can upload their own analysis methods and data to workspaces or run the Broad’s best practice tools and pipelines."

  title: "How to Submit Data"
  primaryContentImage: ''
  content:
    - paragraph: "Submitters should start by reading the $$[CDS Submission Guide](https://github.com/CBIIT/datacommons-assets/raw/main/cds/about/CDSUserGuide.pdf)$$ and then contact the CDS Help desk (cdshelpdesk@mail.nih.gov) with a completed $$[Submission Questionnaire](https://github.com/CBIIT/datacommons-assets/raw/main/cds/about/CDSDataSubmissionForm.pdf)$$. Once the questionnaire is received, we’ll schedule a short interview to discuss the requirements for submitting to CDS, to make sure we understand the data, and that we are a good fit for your project. If your project is accepted, the next step will be to fill out a $$[CDS metadata template](https://github.com/CBIIT/cds-model/blob/main/metadata-manifest/CDS_submission_metadata_template-v1.3.1.xlsx?raw=true)$$ that includes things such as samples, filenames, MD5 checksums for the files, and file size."
    - paragraph: "Once the metadata template is complete, we’ll send you credentials and instructions on how to upload your data to a cloud S3 bucket. We have open office hours and can walk you through the technical details to help you get started. Once you are done uploading, reach out to us to notify us and we will lock the bucket (you will continue to have read-only access to the bucket). "
    - paragraph: "Once the upload is complete, we’ll use the metadata manifest to index the data so it can be made available via NCI Cloud Resources. Please note that our indexing process can take six to eight weeks. "
    - paragraph: "After the indexing is complete, the data will be available through NCI’s Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC). Studies containing controlled access data will require authentication through eRA Commons and dbGaP. You will still be able to access your data after the release in the Seven Bridges through the $$[Cancer Data Service Explorer](https://cgc.sbgenomics.com/datasets/file-repository)$$ "
